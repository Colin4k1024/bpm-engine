## [0.1.0] - First formal commitment

**What is stable**

- Process-instances, history, trace, and external-task APIs, and their semantics (docs/api-spec.md §8, §9).
- History/Trace: append-only events, globally ordered per instance, deterministic replay, persistence-first.
- Invariant violation response: `X-Invariant-Violation` header and error body contract.

**What is NOT stable / may evolve**

- Replay API (session/step/seek), UI/Inspector, SDK helper interfaces, and future Python SDK may be extended or adjusted; they do not affect the stable set above.

**What users can rely on**

- The stable APIs and semantics above will not receive breaking changes within minor/patch versions.
- History is auditable and replayable; causal order and persistence-first are design commitments.

---

### Added (v0.1.0)

- Defined and frozen History / Trace semantic guarantees (docs/api-spec.md).
- Workspace layout: `bpm-core`, `bpm-storage`, `bpm-runtime`, `bpm-adapter-memory`, `bpm-server-rest` crates (refactor.md).
- Async storage traits in `bpm-storage`; memory adapter and unified `MemoryRepo` in `bpm-adapter-memory`.
- Async event pump and handlers in `bpm-runtime`; REST server in `bpm-server-rest`.

### Changed (v0.1.0)

- Root package re-exports workspace crates; main binary moved to `bpm-server-rest` (`cargo run -p bpm-server-rest`).
